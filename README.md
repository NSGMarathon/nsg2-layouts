# nsg2-layouts

Broadcast graphics for speedrun marathon events from the [Norway Speedrunner Gathering](https://nsgmarathon.com/), informally known as "Norskontrol" or "inkontrol".

## Preamble

I've published the source code for these graphics so others may learn from them as I learned from 
[nodecg-speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol) and [agdq19-layouts](https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/agdq19-layouts)
while writing these graphics. With that in mind, **please do not use these graphics as-is** and use them as a reference to learn or as a base for a new project.
The use of Norway Speedrunner Gathering's logos or other image assets is forbidden without prior permission.

#### Time zones

Find a list of time zones [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List).

#### Music

Music information is gathered through foobar2000 with the [beefweb](https://github.com/hyperblast/beefweb) plugin installed.

#### X32 integration

When configuring mixer channel mappings (`x32.channelMappings` and `x32.visibleChannels`), the following channel types are accepted:
`CHANNEL`, `AUX_IN`, `FX_RETURN`, `BUS`, `MATRIX` & `DCA`

#### OBS Websocket

nsg2-layouts can be used in conjunction with a [modified build of obs-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/pull/1229)
to react to scene changes when a transition starts as opposed to when it completes. If this build is in use, set the
`obs.sceneDataInTransitionEvents` property in the bundle configuration file to `true`. Otherwise, set it to `false`.

#### Visualizer & Camera spaces

Set `intermission.addVisualizerSpace` to `true` in the configuration file to add an empty space to the intermission 
graphic, intended for an audio visualizer. This hasn't been used in any live NSG events.

Set `intermission.addCameraSpace` to `false` in the configuration file to remove the cutout intended for a camera feed
from the intermission graphic, useful for online events.

#### Error Reporting

nsg2-layouts may use a Discord webhook to report encountered errors to broadcast staff. 
**Currently, this is only in use to report errors encountered during speedrun playlist playback.** The stream is 
expected to run automatically without human intervention as long as the playlist is running, so it is important that any 
anomalies are spotted and reported, even when nobody is actively monitoring the status of the show.

Configure the `errorReporting.mentions` property to define Discord user IDs to receive alerts. 
Roles may be alerted by adding the `&` character before the role ID.

## Usage

### Game layout

Opening the game layout graphic with the `is-layout-leader` query parameter allows it to take charge of positioning 
camera sources in OBS. This allows multiple game layout graphics to be open without them potentially interfering with 
one another.  
Example: `http://localhost:9090/bundles/nsg2-layouts/graphics/game-layout.html?is-layout-leader`

To use the secondary and tertiary game layout feeds, add the `feed` query parameter.  
Example: `http://localhost:9090/bundles/nsg2-layouts/graphics/game-layout.html?is-layout-leader&feed=1` shows the secondary game layout feed
(Shown as "Feed 2" in the stream tech dashboard.)

### Scene name rules

The following suffixes may be added to the end of OBS scene names to modify the stream while those scenes are in the program feed.
- `[M]`: Play music
- `[G]`: Unmute game audio
- `[R]`: Unmute runners

These suffixes may be combined. For example, a scene named `Test Scene [MG]` will play music and unmute the game audio while it is in the program feed.

### Oengus login

Logging in to Oengus is possible using the Data Import dashboard panel. All Oengus functionality is present without doing 
so, but schedules will be imported without any cache on Oengus' side if the logged-in user is a moderator of the marathon 
being imported. This means that updates to the schedule will appear without any delay.

## npm commands
